TextClick 2023 [Version 8.0.1.477]
Program created by Nathan Renaud (SteelsOfLiquid)

Hello, and thanks for using my program, TextClick 2023! This program is a MDI (multi-document interface) text
editor based for the Win32 platform. This is the instruction manual for this program. If you want to find the
source for this program, it was created using Bloodshed Dev-C++ 5.11 using a 32-bit compiler on my trusty MSI
Prestige 14 Evo A11M running Windows 11. You may find it (as well as the compiler logs) in the folder titled
"source".

Official System Requirements:
This program is really basic and you do not need a beefy computer to run the program. Just saying that, so you
don't go flexing at your friends like "My PC can run TextClick 2023!!! I bet your PC can't run that program!".
Bro, we know you have a PC that can run my software program. But that is something you CAN flex over Mac users.
Anyways, let's get to the system requirements:
Officially Supported OSes: Microsoft Windows 98 (Codename: Memphis), Windows 2000 (Codename: NT 5.0), Windows XP (Codename: Whistler), Windows Vista (Codename: Longhorn), Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11.
Unsupported OSes: Windows 1.0x, Windows 2.x, Windows 3.x/3.1x, Windows NT 3.x*, Windows 95*, Windows NT 4.0*, Windows 96**, Windows ME*, ReactOS*, Microsoft Neptune**, Classic Mac OS, Mac OS X (macOS/OS X), Linux (all distributions, unless there's one using *.exe files), Android, Steel OS 1.x, Steel OS 2.x/3.x***, any other OS not specified.
(*: TextClick may run, but it has not bee confirmed on this platform; **: Cancelled Pre-release version of Microsoft Windows (Windows 96 refers to Microsoft Codename Nashville); ***: A Steel OS release of TextClick is coming soon)
Processor: 32-bit single-core CPU or better.
Graphics: No limit, but 256 colors or better is recommended.
RAM: N/A
Hard Drive or SSD: 8 MB or better

Installation:
TextClick is installed if you're viewing this document. If you want to, you can move this folder to "Program Files" or "Program Files (x86)" (depending on the version of Windows you're running), and if you do that, it is recommended that you create shortcuts to the program on the Start menu and/or on the desktop (or if you're like me and place all your desktop shortcuts in a dedicated Applications folder). This program should be installed from a *.zip file, if you did not receive the program in that file format, than you likely obtained the program from a third party, and you may end up with potentially unwanted software on your system as a result.

First Run:
When you first run the program, if you're using a newer version of Windows, Windows Defender SmartScreen may show up with a pop-up telling you not to run programs you randomly downloaded off of the Internet. Most of the time, you don't have to be concerned about this pop-up, it's shown up for me a lot, examples being a Japanese desktop buddy program I have on my PC as well as Steel OS emulators. Just click "Run Anyway" (may need an extra step), and you'll be fine.
However, I should note that unlike other programs, TextClick 2023 will also likely bring up a warning from your antivirus or other security program (examples: Avast Free Antivirus, even Symantec Endpoint Protection). Tell it that you want to run the program anyway, as I do not create malware (Not even if it is requested, as I do not have the skill to create malware, which often times is illegal). Depending on your security program, you may need to create extra exceptions for the program, for things such as allowing the program to read or write data to files, but with most antivirus software I've used, it only needs one prompt to tell you the program is okay.
Adding on to the last paragraph, I will note one antivirus/security program does not play around with these programs: Symantec Endpoint Protection. These programs have not been tested with Symantec Endpoint Protection in over two years, as the last time any programs have been tested, this security program thought these programs were malware and placed them in quarantine.
If you want to, feel free to associate the *.txcl file format with TextClick 2023 (it may be already associated with TextClick 7, if you used it). However, it will not change the experience of the program. You will still need to open a file from inside the program via the "Open" menu.

Menus:
TextClick 7 may not appear to do much, but that is because it is an MDI (Multi-Document Interface) program, so it does not create a new document immediately. You have to create a new document with the "New" button (should a blank file icon) or through "New" in the "File" menu. The "File" menu allows you to create new files, open pre-existing files, save files, save copies of the file (through "Save As"), or exit the program. The "Edit" menu allows you to cut, copy, and paste, as well as undo any mistakes you made. (Warning: There is no "Redo" option. If you click "Undo", you will not be able to go back.) Lastly, the "Window" menu allows you to organize windows for open documents.

Saving Files:
Click "Save" or "Save As" to save a document. The options are:
- *.txcl (TextClick 7 or 2023 Document)
- *.txt (Standard Text File)
(Potentially new file formats coming soon!)
Once a file is saved, you will be able to close it safely.

Warnings:
- Some antivirus or other security programs may think TextClick 2023 is malware. This is not true, this is only because I, the developer of TextClick 2023, am not affiliated with any business whatsoever.
- If you click "Undo", you will not be able to go back. There is no "Redo" option.
- This program theoretically will run on Windows 95/NT 4.0/ME. I do not know what the results would be though, and I won't put in the time to try and see if they run on these versions of Windows, so for now, do not try and run these programs on these versions of Windows.
- Upon closing either the document or window, TextClick does not prompt you if you want to discard changes. It will not save changes unless you tell it to save changes. So, if you want to close a document after making changes, click the "Save" button first.
