Recently, I tested TextClick 2023 (aka TextClick 8.0) on Ubuntu 23.04.
Despite being Win32-based, it is still possible to run this program on Linux.

If you are using Linux and want to use the program, download the program like normal.
But, in order to RUN the program, you will need WINE. Once WINE is installed, type into
your console, the following command:

wine start -unix [drag and drop the program into the console and it should automatically add the program path]

Unlike running the program on Windows 98, I have done a more thorough compatibility test, testing the following:
- Mini-ribbon
- New file (both ribbon and menu)
- Save file (both ribbon and menu)
- Window Manipulation

In fact, running TextClick and the other programs built on the same foundation loads special icons not found on
the Windows version.

*This guide also applies to Analysis-72 and WebStudio.
